# Milestone project two - Isle of Man tourist information website 
The Isle of Man is often considered the motorcycling capital of the world with the annual Tourist Trophy (TT) races drawing thousands of tourists to the island. With COVID halting tourism globally, this has already lead to the postponement of the 2020 TT and could eventually lead to the full cancellation of the TT races full stop! This would damage tourism on the island so the island needs to find ways to boost tourism and draw interest in the island.

The website aims to provide summary information to potential tourists before they visit the island. The information is provide in summary form as people do not want to trawl through pages and pages of information. This can be quite off putting.
